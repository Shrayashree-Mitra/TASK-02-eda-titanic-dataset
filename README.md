# TASK-02-eda-titanic-dataset
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Python, followed by visualization of insights using Power BI.
## Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.
The analysis combines Python for data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI for visualization and insights.
 # Tools and Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and feature engineering
VS Code for Python development
Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
# Data Cleaning and Preparation
The following steps were performed before visualization:
Removed rows with missing critical values
Created categorical groups for:
Age (Children, Teenagers, Adults, Seniors)
Fare (Low to Luxury ranges)
Ensured consistent data types and valid values
Prepared the cleaned dataset for Power BI analysis
# Key Insights
Out of 884 passengers, only 335 survived, while 549 did not, indicating an overall survival rate of less than 40%.
Passenger class had a significant impact on survival-- First-class passengers had a much higher survival rate, while third-class passengers experienced the highest number of fatalities.
Gender played a critical role in survival outcomes.-- Female passengers had a substantially higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
The 20–35 age group formed the largest portion of passengers and recorded the highest number of deaths.
Children showed comparatively better survival outcomes.
Fare amount influenced survival probability.--Passengers who paid higher fares generally had better survival rates than those in lower fare groups.
Overall, socioeconomic factors, gender, and age strongly influenced survival chances.
# Conclusion
This exploratory analysis highlights clear survival patterns in the Titanic dataset.
The results show that survival was not random but strongly associated with passenger class, gender, age, and fare, reflecting the social and economic dynamics of the time
