# Task 02 – Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset using Python and presenting insights through data visualization. The main objective of this task was to understand the dataset, handle data quality issues, and extract meaningful insights using exploratory data analysis techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this task contains structured data relevant to the problem statement provided in the internship. Before analysis, the dataset required cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Power BI

## What Was Done
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Inspected the dataset structure and data types
- Identified and handled missing or inconsistent values
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Python
- Calculated summary statistics to understand data patterns
- Created visualizations in Power BI to represent key insights clearly

## Outcome
Through this task, the dataset was transformed into a clean and analysis-ready format. The exploratory analysis and visualizations helped in understanding trends, patterns, and relationships within the data
